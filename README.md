# Rails Task Manager

Letâ€™s build a To Do Manager with the basic CRUD features:

1. As a user, I can list tasks
2. As a user, I can view the details of a task
3. As a user, I can add a new task
4. As a user, I can edit a task (mark as completed / update title & details)
5. As a user, I can remove a task
